# Servo-Driver-for-UTAT

This is my first project in UTAT Rocketry Avionics where alongside my partner in the project we designed the board that will control the servos of the rocket, by receiving information from an arduino, and translating and amplifying that current.
Some features are:
- Use of the PCA9685
- IC2 Address
- External clock
- Connection to Arduino
